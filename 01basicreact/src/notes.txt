react koi bhagwan nhi hy. aj hy, ho skta hy kl na ho.

React roadmap

1. Why to learn React?
har cheez ka koi maqsad hota hy. mmacbook example. sirf iss wja sy nhi sekhna chahye k hype, job, trend, build ui hy. ui tu app js/jquery/css/css libraries sy bhi build kr skty hein. suppose krein k aik pic hy, aik name hy aur 2/3 link hein. yeh to sirf html/css/js sy hi ho jaye ga, is k liye to react ki zaroorut hi nhi. overkill ho jaye ga. q k at the end, browser sirf html/css/js ko hi understand krta hy aur hmein apny react code to html/css/js mein compile krna hi pry ga. 
makes easy to manage and build complex frotends. aik button click kro to 4/5 kaam ho jayen. 

2. When should I learn React?

After mastering js. like "completing chai aur javascript" playlist
most projects don't need react in initial stage.

3. Why react was created.

ghost message problem faced by facebook. to solve this issue, react was created.
state is in js, and ui is in dom. ab in dono(js and dm) ko apas mein sync hona chahye tha, jo k nhi ho rhy.

4. Don't learn React if

you don't know how JS works or DOM works(you can see hitesh "Inner browser working video"

5. React learning Process

either 1. go in depth or by 2. by making projects. we will first build projects and along building project, will go in depth.

6. React is a library.

you can think of framework as military and library as cool dude. like agr aik cheez aesy krni hy to framework k case mein hmien wesy hi krni pry gi, jub k library hmy flxibilities deti hy.

7. Topics to learn

cor of React (state or UI manipulation, JSX)
component reusability
reusing of component (props)
how to propogate change (hooks)

8. Additional Addon to React

Router (React don't have Router) we will implement it with React-Router-DOM
state management (React don't have state management)
----> Redux, Redux toolkit(I think more abstracted from of Redux), zustand, context API
class based component i.e. legacy code
BAAS Apps ---> appbase, firebase, supabase ---> social media clone, e-commerce app.

9. After React
React is not a complete solution in most case
---> no seo, browser render of js, no routing
frameworks
NEXT js, Gatsby, Remix


****Steps to create a react project*****

1. create repo on github or create folder on deskto, and name it what you want to name your outer folder. like chai-aur-react
2. create readme.md
3. git init
4. git add readme.md
5. git commit -m 'start of react series'
6. git branch -M main
7. git remote add origin https://github.com/Fan
8. git push -u origin main 


jo react ki core library hy to react hy. ab aap agr web py kaam krna chahty hein to react-dom sekhien, aur agr aap mobile py kaam krna chahty hein to react-native sekhein.

apko react ki new documentation react.dev py mily gi. old documentation py na chly jaye ga.

inside chai-aur-react, type
9. npx create-react-app 01basicsreact(very time consuming, hum dekhien gy k kesy hum parcel or vite k thru bhi project create kr skty hein)
10. cd 01basicreact
11. npm run start
12. OPTIONAL. uper waly process of ctrl c kr k yeh run krein. npm run build. aik build wala folder bun jaye ga jis mein react js mein convert hwi ho gi
13. remove all inside src except App.js and index.js

inside chai-aur-react, type
9. npm create vite@latest 
10. write project name in our ex. 01vitereact
